mongodb_install
===============

Install MongoDB packages on Debian and RedHat based platforms. Installs the mongodb-org meta-package which then installs the following packages: mongodb-org-server, mongodb-org-shell, mongodb-org-mongos, mongodb-org-tools.

Role Variables
--------------

specific_mongodb_version - Install a specific version of mongodb i.e. 4.4.1. The specified version must be available in the system repositories. By default this variable is undefined.
mongodb_hold_packages - Runs the lock_mongodb_packages.sh script to either lock mongodb-org packages at a specific version or to release the lock. Set to "HOLD" or "NOHOLD" as desired. No checks are made to see if the hold already exists or not. By default this variable is undefined and the script is not executed. The task is executed at the end and it is possible that packages could be upgraded before the lock is initially applied.

Dependencies
------------
